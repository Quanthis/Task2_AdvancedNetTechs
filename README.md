# Task2_AdvancedNetTechs
Second task assigned for 'Advanced Net Technologies' subject

Please launch it from file with extension aspx, otherwise it won't find URL to launch itself
In case it throws exceptions all the time (and for now it does, as I don't yet know how to force GC not to delete values of variables that I still need)
  You can change compilation type of inner project Task2_AdvancedNetTechs to console app (currently class library (dll), and then it will take file at input and will give file at ouput
